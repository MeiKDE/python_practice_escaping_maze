# Reeborg's World

Reeborg's World is a programming environment where children can learn programming by solving maze-like puzzles. The mazes are generated randomly and the children can use their programming skills to solve the puzzles. The mazes are designed to be challenging and require the children to think creatively and logically.

Reeborg's World is available as a web application and as a Python library. The web application is available at [reeborg.ca](http://reeborg.ca) and the Python library is available on PyPI as the `reeborg` package.    

The web application is designed to be used with a modern web browser and is optimized for touch screens. The Python library is designed to be used with Python 3 and is optimized for use in a Jupyter notebook or in a Python script.
